<h1> Hello There! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>I'm a finnish "coder hobbyist" that is currently studying in high school. My main programming languages are:</p>
<b><ul>
<li>
Python
</li>
<li>
HTML (Not really a programming language)
</li>
<li>
CSS (Not really a programming language)
</li>
</ul>
</b>
<p>My main operation system is <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Arch</a>
I use Fedora/Windows on my laptop.</p>
<p>My favorite code editor is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" rel="noreffer" target="_blank">vscode</a></p>
<p>I tend to create all sorts of stuff, but usually i'm way too lazy to finish everything.</p>
